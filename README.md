Project: <b>Tic Tac Toe Game</b>
<br>
I created a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns, detects win and draw conditions, and provides a clean user interface with responsive design for smooth gameplay. It's a fun way to demonstrate DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
